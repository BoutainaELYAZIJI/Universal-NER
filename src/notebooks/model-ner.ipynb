I am from England. I am eighteen years old. My father is German. My mother is English. I have two brothers. I have one sister. We are a good family.\n\nMy father is a good businessman. We have money. I have a good school. I have a good life. But I have a dream. I want to travel. I want to see the world.\n\nMy father is a good man. He wants the best for me. But my dream is not his dream. He is not happy. The situation is not easy.\n\nIt is morning. My father is in his room. He wants to speak with me. I go to his room. My father has some questions. My father wants to know why I want to travel.\n\nMy father says, “Travelling is dangerous. Travelling is not comfortable. You can die.”\n\nI think about it. Travelling is dangerous. It is not comfortable. I can die. But it is also very interesting. I can see new countries. I can meet new people.\n\nI think about travelling every day. Maybe my mother can help me.\n\nI speak with my mother. I tell my mother, “I want to travel. I want to see the world. Please, speak with my father. Maybe with your help, I can travel.”\n\nMy mother loves me. But she thinks that travelling is dangerous. She thinks that my place is at home. She thinks that life in England is the best for me.\n\nOne year later, I visit one big town. The name of this town is Hull.\n\nI meet my friend. His father has a ship. They travel to London. My friend tells me, “Go with me.”\n\nI think about it. I am not prepared. But I can try if travelling is for me.\n\nI go to London. I am very happy. It is my first long journey. It is very interesting. The first hour is good. But then we have problems. We see a storm. The storm is big.\n\nThe wind is strong. The ship goes up and down. I have fear. I think about my home. I think about my comfortable bed.\n\nThe storm is finished in the morning. The weather is nice. And the evening is beautiful. Everything is quiet.\n\nOne man comes to me. We speak. We speak about the storm. I speak about my fear. The man gives me a drink. I drink very much. I sleep very well at night.\n\nThe next day, I forget about my home. I forget about my comfortable bed.
